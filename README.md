I am a Computer Science student who enjoys solving technical problems, researching and developing new technologies, and designing software applications. 

I am familiar with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including JavaScript, Node.js , Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL, but Iâ€™m always open to adding new skills to my repertoire and getting involved with new projects that can help me learn or apply all that I have learned throughout my career.
